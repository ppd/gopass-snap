summary: The slightly more awesome Standard Unix Password Manager for Teams
description: | 
  gopass is a rewrite of the pass password manager in Go with the aim of making it 
  cross-platform and adding additional features. Our target audience are professional 
  developers and sysadmins (and especially teams of those) who are well versed with a 
  command line interface. One explicit goal for this project is to make it more approachable 
  to non-technical users. We go by the UNIX philosophy and try to do one thing and do it well, 
  providing a stellar user experience and a sane, simple interface.
